# Weed-plant-detection-from-agricultural-field-images
Weed plant detection is a new research problem in agricultural field which want to  take help from computational science to detect unwanted growth of weed along with  other crops/plants. Usually in farming when we farmers grew something due to soil  property and pre available micro seeds additional growth of weeds is there which spoil  the actual outcome of farming as they affect the growth of planted plants. So weed  detection is problem of accurately identifying the area of weeds so that specific areas can  be targeted for spraying with minimum spraying on the other plants of interest. In recent  years, as the world population growth, existing land and natural resources decreased, the  precision agriculture is increasingly capturing more attention of the researchers. Image  processing approaches could be applied to solve this problem
